# Graph Mining Project
## Introduction

This project focuses on graph mining techniques applied to the Deezer Europe dataset from SNAP (Stanford Network Analysis Project). The dataset contains information about the social network of Deezer users in Europe, and we aim to analyze and extract meaningful patterns and insights from this data, such as centrality, community detection or embedding.
